I dunno about you, but I'm sick of Handbrake's pathetic handling of non-disc-based batch processing. This tool is meant to act as an analog to the excellent HandBrakeBatch on OSX (http://www.osomac.com/apps/osx/handbrake-batch/) while learning to work with other people's code and get around to learning C#.
